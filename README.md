# Tower of Hanoi Game

An interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle. Move all disks from one peg to another using an intuitive visual interface with dropdown menus and buttons.

## Live Demo

- Will be learning how to deploy soon.

## How to Play

1. Select the number of disks you want to play with (3, 4, or 5)
2. Use the dropdown menus to select which peg to move from and to
3. Click "Move Disk" to execute your move
4. **Goal:** Move all disks from peg 1 to either peg 2 or peg 3

### Rules

- Only one disk can be moved at a time
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk

## Features

- **Visual game board** - See the pegs and disks rendered on screen
- **Adjustable difficulty** - Choose between 3, 4, or 5 disks
- **Move validation** - Prevents illegal moves automatically
- **Win detection** - Alerts you when you've solved the puzzle
- **Reset functionality** - Start over at any time
- **Responsive design** - Works on desktop and mobile

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- Google Fonts (Cascadia Code)

## What I Learned

- Refactoring JavaScript to TypeScript for improved type safety
- Dynamic DOM manipulation and rendering
- Managing complex game state with arrays
- Event handling with bootstrap form controls
- Creating responsive layouts with Bootstrap
- Building interactive web applications without frameworks

## Future Enhancements

- Add move counter to track efficiency
- Create an auto-solve feature that demonstrates the optimal solution
