Tower of Hanoi Game

- console-based implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle built with vanilla JavaScript. Solve the puzzle by moving all disks from one peg to another using function calls in the browser console.

Updates:

- Added Bootstrap and Cascadia Code font
- Implemented the ability to change the number of disks
- Redid the whole UI presented in cards with dropdown menus and buttons

Rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time
- A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk
- Goal: Move all 5 disks from peg 1 to either peg 2 or peg 3

Reset the game:

- Click the "Reset" button on the page to start over

What I Learned:

- How to refactor into TypeScript
- Implementing the Tower of Hanoi game with array manipulation
- Managing game state with JavaScript arrays
- Input validation and move legality checking
- DOM event handling for reset functionality
- Console-based user interaction

Future Enhancements:

- Display the board using HTML and accept user input via Web APIs
- Implement solve button that can solve from any given state
