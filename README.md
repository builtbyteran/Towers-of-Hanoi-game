Tower of Hanoi Game

- console-based implementation of the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle built with vanilla JavaScript. Solve the puzzle by moving all discs from one peg to another using function calls in the browser console.

How to Play:

- Open the game in your browser
- Open the browser console
- Use the moveDisc(source, target) function to move discs between pegs

Example:

- moveDisc(1, 3) // Moves top disc from peg 1 to peg 3
- moveDisc(1, 2) // Moves top disc from peg 1 to peg 2

Rules:

- Only one disc can be moved at a time
- A larger disc cannot be placed on top of a smaller disc
- Goal: Move all 5 discs from peg 1 to either peg 2 or peg 3

Reset the game:

- Click the "Reset" button on the page to start over

What I Learned:

- Implementing the Tower of Hanoi game with array manipulation
- Managing game state with JavaScript arrays
- Input validation and move legality checking
- DOM event handling for reset functionality
- Console-based user interaction

Future Enhancements:

- Display the board using HTML and accept user input via Web APIs
- Add ability to change the number of pegs/discs and update the game board and playing style
- Implement solve button that can solve from any given state
